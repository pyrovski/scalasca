<h2>Scalasca instrumentation/measurement regions</h2>

<a name="EPIK"><h3>EPIK</h3></a>
<dl>
<dt>Description:</dt>
<dd>
    Synthetic events/regions associated with activities of the EPIK measurement system.
<p>
   A <tt>TRACING</tt> region indicates intermediate trace buffer flushing to file,
as well as measurement initialization and finalization (including clock offset
determination) even when tracing is disabled.
<p>
   A <tt>PAUSING</tt> region marks when measurement was explicitly paused
via EPIK user API macros.  Events are not recorded while measurement is paused.
<p>
    A special <tt>PARALLEL</tt> region is synthesized to encapsulate MPI regions
if an MPI region is the first to be encountered.  It defines the parallel execution
between <tt>MPI_Init</tt> (or <tt>MPI_Init_thread</tt>) and <tt>MPI_Finalize</tt>.
<p>
    A special <tt>UNKNOWN</tt> region can also appear in measurements
and is used to indicate various problems, such as failure to determine the actual
name of a routine or truncation of the call-tree due to insufficient capacity.
</dd>
</dl>

<a name="MPI"><h3>MPI</h3></a>
<dl>
<dt>Description:</dt>
<dd>
    Functions from the MPI library for which instrumentation wrappers
were generated and events configured at start of measurement.  Calls to
measured MPI routines may occur in instrumented user sources, or in
uninstrumented sources or libraries, however, MPI calls done internally
by the measurement library or the MPI library itself are not measured.
<p>
    MPI regions cannot be filtered (like user-level regions), however,
sets of regions which are not desired in a measurement can be disabled
by eliminating them from the <tt>EPK_MPI_ENABLED</tt> specification 
in EPIK.CONF or as an environment variable.  Execution time in
uninstrumented or disabled MPI routines will appear attributed to the
calling user-level routine.
</dd>
</dl>

<hr width="75%" align="center">

<a name="OMP"><h3>OMP</h3></a>
<dl>
<dt>Description:</dt>
<dd>
    OpenMP API routines and parallel regions automatically instrumented by
the OpenMP pragma and annotated region instrumenter (OPARI2).  OMP
pragmas [C/C++] and executable directives [Fortran] are uniformly named with the
"<tt>!$omp</tt>" prefix, the construct, and the source location (<tt>@filename:lineno</tt>).
<p>
    OMP regions cannot be filtered (like user-level regions) during
measurement, however, source files containing OpenMP can be instrumented
selectively.  Furthermore, OPARI2 can be configured to disable
instrumentation of some or all of the more fine-grained OpenMP
constructs <tt>atomic</tt>, <tt>critical</tt>, <tt>flush</tt>, <tt>locks</tt>,
<tt>master</tt> and <tt>single</tt>.
</dd>
</dl>

<hr width="75%" align="center">

<a name="USR"><h3>USR</h3></a>
<dl>
<dt>Description:</dt>
<dd>
    Ordinary user-level routines instrumented automatically by the compiler or PDT instrumenter,
    and source code regions manually instrumented with POMP directives or EPIK user API macros.
    (Currently the different types of user-level routines are not distinguished.)
    Routine names provided by compilers may or may not include decorations such as
    trailing underscores, embedded file/module names, parameters and return values.
    For C++, the original routine name may be determined with a "demangler" library
    (if supported and configured with Scalasca).
<p>
    If the frequent execution of a routine results in substantial overhead
    (either through measurement dilation or trace buffer capacity), consider
    specifying its name in a filter used for subsequent measurements, or
    apply selective instrumentation (e.g., via the PDT instrumenter).
</dd>
</dl>

<hr width="75%" align="center">

<a name="COM"><h3>COM</h3></a>
<dl>
<dt>Description:</dt>
<dd>
    The COM designation applies to callpaths (rather than regions) and
is used to signify common paths to OMP/MPI
communication/synchronization routines and USR local computation, as
reported by the <tt>cube3_score</tt> utility.  The
associated regions provide context that is valuable for distinguishing
instances of communication/synchronization routines and corresponding
computation phases.  While they are typically compiler-instrumented USR
regions, and can also be filtered from measurement at run-time, usually
this is neither necessary nor desirable.
